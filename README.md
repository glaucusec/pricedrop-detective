# PriceDrop-Detective.

PriceDrop-Detective is a Node.js project designed to help users track price changes for products, with a focus on products listed on Amazon. By providing a product's URL, this website can monitor the product daily for any changes in its price.

## Implementation

The project leverages Node.js and utilizes the Puppeteer package for web scraping. Asynchronous features of JavaScript, such as Promises, have been effectively used to manage functions efficiently. 

## Features

- Share an Amazon product URL with the website, and it will continuously monitor price changes.
- Easily toggle tracking on and off with a simple button click.
- Access additional details about individual products.
- Visualize price changes over time with a line chart for quick insights.
